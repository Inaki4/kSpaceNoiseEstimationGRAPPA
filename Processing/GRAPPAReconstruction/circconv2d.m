function [Y] = circconv2d(X,h)
%CIRCCONV2D It computes the circular convolution of X with filter h
%We get the size of the filter. Ideally both dimensions are odd so the
%filter can be centered in each point. If one dimension is even, we take
%the center in the first half, like if it is 4x4, we take the center at the
%point (2,2).
