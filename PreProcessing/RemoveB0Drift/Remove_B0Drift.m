function []=Remove_B0Drift(filepath,filename)
%Remove_B0Drift Function to correct for the B0 drift in the data
%comparing the g-factors in the case when the ACS region is present for the
%real phantom
%   - filepath: path where the file containing the acquisition is storesd
%   - filename: file to preprocess and correct for B0drift
