DETAILS

Water phantom acquisition: 100 realizations of the same fully-encoded slice of a water phantom doped with
3.3685 g/L of nickel chloride hydrate (N iCl2 − 6H2O) and 2.4 g/L of sodium chloride (N aCl), scanned in
an 8-channel head coil on a 3.0 T scanner (MR750, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI). Acquisition parameters
included: TE/TR=2.0/11.8 msec, flip angle=3◦ , FOV=220x220 mm2, matrix size=128x128, slice thickness=3
mm, bandwith=±62.5KHz, scan time=15.51 sec. A decay in the magnitude of the magnetization was observed
for the initial repetitions. The detailed cause of these decay is beyond the scope of this work, but it could be
associated to temperature changes during the acquisition, as well as steady-state effects. In order to avoid it,
the acquisition was repeated with 200 realizations, discarding the first 100. Due to multiple experimental effects
(eg: temperature effects), the central frequency can shift between realizations. This drift in the B0 field would
introduce phase shifts between realizations that would cause errors in the noise estimation. In order to minimize
these errors, the phase shift between realizations was estimated from the center of the k-space as a cubic function
of time and removed by postprocessing.
